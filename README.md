## Description
The **Sequence_analyzer** toolkit includes the following key features:
- **run_dna_rna_tools**: Analyze and manipulate DNA and RNA sequences. It works with additional modules that allow to perform the following operations: transcribing a sequence, returning a reverse sequence, finding a complementary chain and returning a reverse complementary sequence.
- **filter_fastq**: Filter FASTQ sequences based on various criteria including GC content, sequence length, and quality thresholds. Returns a dictionary consisting only of those sequels that satisfy all the conditions.

The toolkit is designed to streamline genomic data processing, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced users.
## Installation

To use the Sequence_analyzer toolkit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bulatych/Sequence_analyzer_tools.git
   cd sequence-analyzer
